`anki-csv` is a tool to validate whether csv files comply with [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)'s basic flashcard format.


## Scope

In particular, it checks that:

* Every line is either a comment (starting with a `#` and not containing at least one comma), empty or belongs to a valid Anki card representation.
* A row can belong to a valid Anki card representation if
  * It is a single row and has exactly one comma 'outside' of a pair of double quotes (`"`), but an arbitrary amount of commas inside double quotes - this is the entire card. 
	* For example,
		```
		Very well, Muy bien
		Best movie, "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"
		```
	  are both valid while the following is not:
		```
		Best movie, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
		```
  * It is part of a properly quoted multi-line pair.
	* For example,
		```
		Very well, Muy bien
		Ways to become wealthier, "1. Spend less
		2. Earn more
		3. Inherit
		"
		A bike, un v√©lo
		```
	  is valid.

For more examples, see the `tests` subdirectory.

## Usage as pre-commit hook

Either create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in the top level
of your repository or add an entry to `repos`:

```yml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/kklein/anki-csv
    rev: 0.0.1
    hooks:
      - id: anki-csv
```

Once this file has been created or adapted, you can install the hooks, via

```console
$ pre-commit install
```

This will ensure that whenever you try to `git commit`, the hooks will be run first.
If you want to commit despite a hook failing, you can always run:

```console
$ git commit -m "Fix bug" --no-verify
```

Aside from the `git commit` hook mechanism, you can always run the hooks proactively at any
point in time by e.g. running:

```console
$ pre-commit run --all-files
```

Find more details in the [pre-commit docs](https://pre-commit.com/).

## Development

Recommended initial setup looks as follows:
```console
$ git clone git@github.com:kklein/anki-csv.git
$ cd anki-csv
$ mamba env create -f environment.yaml
$ mamba activate anki-csv
$ pre-commit install
```

Then, when changes to the source code have been made, install the package via

```console
$ pip install .
```

and run the tests via

```console
$ pytest tests/
```

## Usage as stand-alone CLI tool

Follow the steps from the Development section above.

Then, run

```console
$ anki-csv /users/kevin/file1.csv /users/kevin/file2.csv /users/kevin/file3.csv
```
